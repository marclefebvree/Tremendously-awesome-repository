# Rutte's influence on taking a shot

__What effect did the Dutch government speeches have on the attitude of their citizens towards the corona-vaccin?__

## Motivation
Currently the COVID-19 pandemic has a large effect on society. The social network Twitter is a way which users can use to voice their opnions via the use of tweets. To detect the sentiment towards the corona-vaccin in the Netherlands this scraper is going to scrape Twitter upon different keywords, within the timeframes around the time the Dutch government speeched to the Dutch citizens about COVID-19 regulations. The hypothesis of our research is that their might be an influence on the opion of citizens about the vaccin leading up to, during and after the speeches. This will be conducted by a sentiment analysis by using the data from the scraper build.
